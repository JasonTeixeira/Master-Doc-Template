# Master Documentation Template for Cloud Architecture & Engineering Projects

The following is a comprehensive documentation template I have developed to streamline the process of documenting cloud architecture and engineering projects that I make public. This template follows the natural lifecycle of architectural and engineering practices, organized in a chronological pipeline for clarity and completeness.

The documentation starts by emphasizing business value, illustrating how the solution or architecture supports and optimizes business operations. Technology, in this context, serves as a means to align with business objectives—ensuring scalability, reliability, security, operational efficiency, and ease of monitoring and management—while remaining adaptable to inevitable changes.

I have aimed to cover 95% of real-world scenarios, taking into account scalability, security, compliance, cost management, and operational nuances. However, I acknowledge that each project is unique, and personalized detailing may be required based on specific use cases.

This template is one example of my approach to documenting projects. For a more TOGAF-focused documentation template, please refer to the "TOGAF Master Documenting Template" repository
